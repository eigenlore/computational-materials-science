# Classical Statistical Mechanics and Molecular Dynamics

This repository contains code and documentation for a course project on classical statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics. The project explores fundamental concepts such as canonical and microcanonical ensembles, the ergodic theorem, and adiabatic approximations. It involves the implementation of molecular dynamics simulations using Lennard-Jones potentials, and also includes Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations and advanced topics like temperature control and rare events.
